<p>We also present our work before academic audiences, both as individual members and as a collective. We are currently preparing the student seminar &ldquo;L&rsquo;évolution culturelle : vers une science naturelle de l&rsquo;histoire humaine&rdquo; for the DEC department of the ENS Ulm. It should have taken place during the second semester of 2019-20, but has been postponed due to the coronavirus crisis.</p>
