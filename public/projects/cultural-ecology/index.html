    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>We are working to study how culture itself builds the niche where culture evolves, or in other words how multi-level interaction between cultural traits build through time the landscape where these same traits evolve. This amounts to study social forms, such as a specific form of ritual, as autonomous organisms engaging in niche construction. For exemple, the invention of a new media could enable the creation of new cultural traits giving more influence to its adepts, and indirectly reinforce its own hegemony.</p>
<p>This process is not limited to the interaction between human and media, as in principle any domain of human culture may influence any other. For exemple, moral religions are known to have significantly altered the nature and reach of complex societies by extending ethnic boundaries and reinforcing moral intuition <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and hierarchical societies have been in part facilitated by their highjacking of psychological, social, and material adaptations to cereal agriculture <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This last fact can exemplify our demarch by exposing economic and political structure as two co-evolving domains, where agricultural States emerge as a self-reinforcing complex due to interaction between different domains of culture.</p>
<p>The present projects aims to build an array of case studies of such dynamics, to identify a formal cultural evolutionary framework to understand it, and to apply its prediction to a prospective account of future transformations of human societies. Listed below are several of our line of analysis.</p>
<h2 id="low-techs">Low techs</h2>
<p>The technological grounding of an economy is known to influence the political institutions of a society in deep and predictile ways. In addition to the above example of State emergence, a technologically intensive export-oriented economy causes power to distribute more evenly among the population <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, probably due to increased coordination and embodied capital of the workers. This result was however obtained in the context of capitalist economies, and is not clear whether it holds in a different structural context.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to study, from an empirical and theoretical perspective, how technology complexity interacts with communal governance norms <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. So-called &ldquo;low techs&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> are a technological paradigm emphasizing sobriety and simplicity over economic efficiency and scalability. As a consequence, they are widely understood to negate the necessity of central actors such as States or corporations, and to form a necessary basis to a post-growth or resilient society <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. We expect that recruiting the multi-scale analysis we defined as cultural ecology would help in assessing the groundings of this expectation.</p>

<h2 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h2>
<p>Mathematics are largely understood as formal systems of representations, living a life of their own completely outside the inflence of material phenomena. Netz&rsquo;s work on the &ldquo;cognitive history&rdquo; of mathematics disqualified this idea by exposing how the structure of Greek mathematical language emerged out of other, non-scientific, aspects of Greek visual and material culture []. The lettered diagram, a crucial tool in Greek mathematics was for example repurposed from its initial use in other, non-scientific practices like navigation or house building ; and the expression mode of the &ldquo;formule&rdquo; emerge from mythological prose [].</p>
<p>This work exposes how the mathematical language emerged from unrelated cultural practices, and was only later recruited as an esoteric field of knowledge in the context of the the highly elitist and competitive Greek society. We argue this is an exemple of cultural co-evolution examplifying more general dynamics of scientific development, and want to accentuate the role of cognitive developement of representations in the history of sciences.</p>
