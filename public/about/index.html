        <p>Kairos Cliodynamics is a grassroots movement of researchers and students of cultural evolution - that is, the science of what processes drive human cultural change and stability. Our purpose is to build, diffuse, and apply knowledge from this discipline to harness its power to help navigate the upcoming late Anthropocene era.</p>
<p>We want to build an open and integrative science that is oriented toward informing the governance of human societies. While we agree to work with academic institutions, we recognise their limitations in terms of reach and inclusivity, and chose to organise as an informal collective. Our ambition, in the long run, would be to become a fully autonomous research center.</p>
<p>We have at the moment two core members : Avel GUÉNIN&ndash;CARLUT (research &amp; editorial manager, infrastructure, coordinating the Paris &amp; Lyon groups) and Nicolas SALERNO (community manager, coordinating the Paris &amp; Marseille groups). Loïa LAMARQUE, Benoît DE COURSON, Léo FITOUCHI also participate in organising and preparing our cultural evolution seminar in ENS Ulm. Raphael RENAUD, Thomas SUAU, and Clara LEVY FAULK work in the context of our pedagogical project. Finally, Iona BRENAC, Can KONUK and Alexis ROZANSKY are involved in our research on epistemology.</p>
