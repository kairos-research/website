We work on articulating cultural evolution research as a tool for governing societies, and in particular to help navigate the upcoming crisis of dominant institutions. Our interests range from the deep history of political and economic institutions to the structural causes of innovation, resilience or revolution. We are especially concerned with research regarding the role of knowledge and ideology in political integration, and the meaning of scientific models.

We are considering the publication an annual bulletin on the matter of cliodynamics and its epistemology. Please get in touch if you want to participate !
