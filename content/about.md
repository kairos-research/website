Kairos Cliodynamics is a grassroots collective of researchers and students of cultural evolution - that is, the science of what processes drive human cultural change and stability. Our purpose is to leverage this discipline into pragmatic insight for managing the upcoming transformations of human societies. We are therefore interested not only

We want to build an open and integrative science that is oriented toward informing the governance of human societies. In this optic, we organised as an informal laboratory dedicated to producing original research in cultural evolution, to diffusing preexisting results, and to applying them in real life settings.

Want to meet us, share ideas, or ask what we're up to ? Mail us at kairoscliodynamics@disroot.org !
