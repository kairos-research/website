## Complexity in the natural sciences

Naturalism is a philosophical and scientific position stating that all observable things belong to the same realm of existence, and follow the same fundamental set of identifyable "natural laws". Natural scientist typically work toward the exposition and formalisation of these laws, notably through the construction of formal, predictive theories and their test in reproducible experimental settings. While this perspective has been highly successful in fields such as astronomy, chemistry, and geology, it is at the moment marginal in the social sciences and generally understood to be inadapted to the complexity of human beings.

Yet, the life sciences examplify how the philosophy of naturalism can apply to such complex systems, differing significantly in their practice and structure to what we understand as "hard", formal science. Physical scientists routinely study systems which respond to stimulation in a regular and predictible way, allowing them to state mathematically tractable laws which are a sufficient description of said system. This is rarely true for life scientist, which may recognise regularities in the way their system behave, but must also deal with hidden dynamics they cannot possibly exclude from their analysis.

For example, a genetically altered mice may grow stronger than a normal one, but this outcome depend on metabolic interaction that cannot be simply ignored if one wants to "explain" this outcome scientifically. This is in contrast to the ideal physical experiment of the falling weight, which drag, rotation, and vibration can be understood as additional dynamics, essentially unrelated to the reason why it falls. These systemic complexity do not prevent life scientists to study organisms in a predictive manner, identifying specific mecanisms of their behaviour and formalising some of the dynamics driving their structure.

A key example of this, evolution theory is a grand theory of how living structures emerge, change and maintain themselves. Yet, it does not claim to be a sufficient description of the living, and does not in itself explain most observable facts about living systems. It is ultimately agnostic regarding the workings of any single organism, although it gives a rich and standard framework in which to integrate biological and ecological studies. Evolution theory, in and of itself, is nothing else than a systematic theory of some specific qualitative regularities characterising life.
