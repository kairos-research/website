The cognitive sciences are an interdisciplinary research project, built in the context of Macy's conferences around the cognitivist paradigm that compares the functioning of the human mind with that of a computer. Sixty-seven years later, this project seems to have exploded between many competing approaches (Núñez et al., 2019), presumably under the abundant evidence of fundamental discrepancies between human cognition and artificial computation (Braitenberg, 1986; Brooks, 1991; Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Damasio, 1995; Varela et al., 2016). Despite this failure to establish an integrated science of human cognition, cognitive psychology remains for some authors a necessary basis for any research in the social sciences and humanities (Sperber, 1996). According to them, only a detailed description of the cognitive dynamics underlying social phenomenons can shed light on their causal mechanisms, and thus integrate them into a global vision of natural phenomenons. I will discuss here the adequacy of this thesis in view of the mathematical approaches that ground our understanding of the passage from the level of individual laws to the level of collective behaviour, as well as contemporary sciences that already study humans as part of the natural world.

Cognitive psychology is in fact mainly built around experiments on isolated individuals in a laboratory context, which seek to shed light on the properties of particular sub-systems that participate in their cognition: decision-making mechanisms, immediate visual perception, attention, ... Rare are the approaches that explicitly integrate behaviours outside the laboratory or the interaction of several individuals. As a result, cognitive approaches to social phenomena tend to highlight the way in which specific cognitive "modules" bias individual behaviours (Barrett & Kurzban, 2006), and often take for granted that these biases are sufficient to explain collective behaviours. From this perspective, Baumard & Boyer (2013) explain, for example, the emergence of moralising religions (i.e. those that articulate an explicit doctrine concerning behaviours favoured or disapproved by one form or another of cosmic justice) from 1000 BC onwards by a prior domestication of populations, which would naturally cause the emergence of theories justifying a posteriori the behaviours already practised by a majority.

Humans constantly interact with each other in ways that structure their individual behaviours, and the structure that connects them is therefore crucial to understanding the emergence of collective behaviours. Simple contagious behaviors can be tested through the following educational game: https://ncase.me/crowds/ . More complex phenomenons, such as the development in humans of relevant models of the world they interact with, depends more on the structure of the network that connects them than on their individual cognitive properties (Derex et al., 2019; Muthukrishna & Henrich, 2016). Moreover, these same networks are known to verify the property of scale invariance (Barabàsi & Bonabeau, 2003), which translates into an extreme contingency of the dynamics taking place on these networks. In other words, events that should be exceptional in view of the average behaviour of individuals are, on the contrary, of notable importance in in eco dynamics. In particular, this structure facilitates the evolution of cooperation (Allen et al., 2017) - and thus the emergence of complex social structures.

It seems hardly surprising, therefore, that established social science approaches - even those specifically constructed in the context of naturalist research, seeking to represent human societies through their underlying causal structure - explicitly take into account phenomena that are irreducibly social. Institutions, and more generally the way in which social norms structure individual behaviour, are for example at the heart of evolutionary and predictive sciences for the development of human societies (Richerson et al., 2016; Turchin, 2011; Wilson et al., 2008). The computational social sciences, for their part, prefer to use very parsimonious models of individual behaviour in order to study precisely the mechanisms by which their properties translate into collective dynamics (Conte et al., 2012). Even the "classical" social sciences have a strong naturalist tradition that largely covers contemporary evolutionary sciences (Wilson et al., 2013), and those that do not often study objects that are inaccessible to a naturalist approach, such as the "epistemic architecture" of representations that populate a society (Ogien, 2011).

Since it wants to show the structure of causal relations that exist in nature, the naturalist research program in fact depends on predictive scientific theories - that is, approaches that are capable of describing in advance the behaviour of the phenomena studied in a given instrumental context (Chalmers, 1990). Its progress therefore depends on the existence of parsimonious theories (i.e., those that do not make strong assumptions about the objects they introduce) and on a wide variety of ways of testing these theories. In other words, it does not really "explain" social phenomena using detailed models of individual cognitive structures, at least without exposing a clear causal link between the individual and the collective level or integrating simpler and more instrumentally mature explanations of these phenomena. It is therefore incumbent on naturalists in the social sciences to articulate theories that do indeed have explanatory power at the level of the phenomena they wish to study, to show precisely and exhaustively their hypotheses and the way in which they structure their predictions, and to judge contradictory theories only on the basis of their concrete scientific results.
