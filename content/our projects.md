We are currently working on several projects relative to cultural evolution, its philosophy, or its application.


## Kairos Journal

We host a minimalist journal of cultural evolution. Our focus is on synthetising the cultural evolution discipline, and leveraging it into pragmatic insight for managing the upcoming transformations of human societies. We discuss a wide range of topics, from the epidemiology of cultural representations to the deep history of institutions, with a special focus on the meaning of scientific knowledge. All have in common their roots in cultural evolution research, and hopefully their interest for informed action in the near future.

We produce reviews of preexisting theories, but also original research from our members. Our main accent is at the moment on accessibility and exhaustivity, and we do not intend to replace mainstream peer-reviewed journals. We do intend however to supplement them by offering a space for rigorous yet clear exposition of their findings, and allowing conceptual or interdisciplinary work to be presented outside the contraints associated to academic specialisation.

This project is coordinated by Avel GUÉNIN--CARLUT, who serves as editorial manager and main reviewer for the Kairos journal.


## Pedagogical project

We are working toward the application of the Core Design Principles (Wilson, David Sloan, Elinor Ostrom, and Michael E. Cox. 2013. ‘Generalizing the Core Design Principles for the Efficacy of Groups’. Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 90: S21–32.), a major theory of sociological economy regarding the ability of groups to self-govern, to the implication of university-level students in their work.

The Core Design Principles inspired various attempts at building more inclusive and functional institutions, most notably in the context of the Evolution Institute. In our case, we are suggesting the constitution of autonomous but interacting study groups so as to generate a feeling of collective identity around the activity of studying.

Raphael RENAUD, Thomas SUAU, and Clara LEVY FAULK work in the context of this project, with Nicolas SALERNO acting as a coordinator.


## Cultural Evolution seminar

We organised a seminar presenting on overview of cultural evolution research with the ENS Ulm Département d'Études Cognitives. Initially programmed from February to April 2020, it was postponed due to the coronavirus crisis.

The goal of the seminar is to give non-experts a general idea of contemporary research relative to human evolution, both in terms of its results and its workings. In this optic, we first present the general framework of evolution theory, then show how humans evolved to become a cultural species. Then, we articulate different approaches for studying the evolution of culture, and their relevance to the historical science. We also give a picture of the institutions leading research in cultural evolution, and address some transversal issues of modelling and epistemology.

This project is driven by Avel GUÉNIN--CARLUT, Nicolas SALERNO, Loïa LAMARQUE, Benoît DE COURSON and Léo FITOUCHI.

## Emergent agents and the naturalisation of social ontology

We collaborate with the ENS Lyon Junior lab of epistemology and social ontology to study the notion of "emergent agents", as conceptualised from a complex systems perspective, and their relevance for social sciences. Examplifying the framework of naturalist philosophy, we intend our work to integrate with scientific enquiry by analysing its underlying concepts, rather than to constitute a separate domain of knowledge.

Our structuring question is whether immaterial agents, such as gods or institutions, do "exist" as social entities, and if so in what sense they exist. We argue that such entities may exist as focal points of causality, intentionality, and even decision-making. In such cases, they are to be considered autonomous agents rather than fantasies, which we will develop the consequences for both anthropological theories of societies and cognitive theories of agentivity.

This project is driven by Avel GUÉNIN--CARLUT, Nathanaël COLIN-JAEGER, Alexis ROZANSKI, and Iona BRENAC.
