We aim to build a website presenting a dynamic map of the world through time on the basis of a collaborative architecture of data collection. A year and a half within the project, our data mainly concerns the geography and demography of political entities such as cities and states. Our long term goal is to add many type of data relative to ecology, religion, economy, material culture...

This work can be accessed on the [CartoWiki website](http://cartowiki.com/). This website is not intended to replace tools of scientific analysis such as the SESHAT database. Instead, it will allow accessible visualisation and analysis of data relevant to the historical development of societies, with the hope that is serves as an entryway into cliodynamic research.

The project is coordinated by Martin Boutroux for the programming component and Gaël Daniel for the data management component.
