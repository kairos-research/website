We organise regular meetings around the presentation of specific articles or research in cultural evolution, cliodynamics, or human evolution. These events are based on voluntary participation of students and young researchers willing to present research articles, or more generally to share their reflexions in a friendly and informal context. In addition, they are an occasion for those interested in cultural evolution to gather around food and drinks, and either participate actively in the discussion or just sit back and listen.

These meetings are heavily inspired by Cognivence's semi-informal "Boisson Articles Fromage" events, which participate in animating the parisian cognitive science community. Contact us for more details or for asking whether we plan to organise meetings in your city !

This project is led by Alina DRACHEVA.
