We are interested in the philosophy of cultural evolution, and how it informs philosophical theories of knowldege (epistemology) and representation of what exists in the world (ontology). We study more particularly the way we build knowledge in cultural evolution theory (its epistemology) and what fundamental entities it invokes to represent the world (its ontology). We argue those are two important elements to the integration of cultural evolution theory to pragmatic action, as they respectively allow to integrate its results to a broader body of knowledge, and to translate it into mundane intuition about the world.


## Naturalism in the social sciences

Cultural evolution can be understood in the context of the broader project of naturalism, the philosophical and scientific position that promotes the mutual integration of all body of knowledge through mechanistic or systemic understanding. This position, while overwhelmingly dominant in life sciences, is not so in the social sciences. Indeed, a wide array of scientists claim that the demarch of the natural sciences cannot be usefully recruited to study the social, whether because of its pragmatic impractibility or because of the existence of human culture outside the realm of natural laws.

We work to expose how the demarch of naturalism applies to the social sciences, both by discussing its abstract epistomological fundations, and by mapping the actual research programms that have emerged in its context. Our intent is both to formalise the scope and methodes of naturalist social sciences, and to help integrate them into the broader context of scientific knowledge of human societies.

This project is led by Avel GUÉNIN--CARLUT.

## Emerging agents

Cultural evolution allowed the emergence of super-individual entities such as ethnic groups, gods, cities, institutions... We intuitively represent entities to be able of autonomous decisions, for exemple by stating that "the Congress passed the bill" or discussing godly intentions. This is widely understood by naturalists as a consequence of oversensitive psychologial mechanisms of agency detection [^1] [^2], and a failure to recognise individual humans as the real center of agency in societies.

This notion is however questionable, as doubts exists on the relevance to the opposition between the "natural" and "cultural" domains of existence [^3], and as relational approaches to sociology underline the participation of collective (or otherwise non-humans) agents in societies [^4]. We therefore work to apply formal tools from the philosophy of cognition and evolution to study the conditions (if any) under which culturally evolved, immaterial entities are able of autonomous perception and action, and can consequently formally be called "agents".

## Collective brain

A recurrent notion in cultural evolution is the characterisation of cumulative cultural evolution as resulting from the ability of social groups to "compute" information through their social structure, in a similar way the human brain does through its biological structure [^5] [^6]. This metaphor accentuates the autonomy of social behaviour in regard to individual cognition and the agency of structured social groups [^7], and guides formal modelling of the emergence of complex societies [^8].

We work to formalise the proper domain of the analogy between cultural evolution and cognition, and to expose its consequences in the concepts we recruit to understand human societies.
