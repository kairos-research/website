The Kairos journal is a minimalist journal of cultural evolution. Its focus is to synthetise theoretical knowledge of social networks, institutional change, collective cognition or other dimensions of cultural evolution, and bridge it with pragmatic insight about human societies. The range of topics we adress is intentionally wide as we aim to ground a systemic understanding of how human interactions drive societies rather than adavance a specific theoretical framework. We are especially interested in discussing what scientific knowledge means from a cultural evolutionary perspective, and how it may guide action in shifting societies.

The Kairos journal is not at the moment a research journal, as it is run by cooptation rather than formal peer review, and is oriented toward diffusing rather than creating scientific knowledge. It is inspired by projects such as [This View of Life](https://evolution-institute.org/this-view-of-life/) in its mandate to simplify research litterature for a broader audience without compromising on its formal quality, or the [ACTE Lab](https://www.acte-lab.com/) in its commitment toward making research accessible and relevant for accompanying future social changes.

This project is coordinated by Avel GUÃ‰NIN--CARLUT, who serves as editorial manager and main reviewer for the Kairos journal.
