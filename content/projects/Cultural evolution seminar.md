We organised a seminar presenting an overview of cultural evolution research with the ENS Ulm Département d’Études Cognitives. Initially programmed from February to April 2020, it was postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus crisis.

The goal of the seminar is to give non-experts a general picture of contemporary research relative to human evolution, including its main results, its contemporary debates, and its institutions. In this optic, we first present the general framework of evolution theory, then show how humans evolved to become a cultural species. From there, we proceed to expose an array of paradagmatic case study such as the psychological fundations to symbolic culture and religious belief, the mecanisms of cumulative cultural evolution, the role of social norms and their reinforcement through storytelling, rituals, and religion, or the evolution of complex societies. We also expose the epistemological and social underpinnings to leading (methodological or theoretical) research programms in cultural evolution.

This project is driven by Avel GUÉNIN–CARLUT, Nicolas SALERNO, Loïa LAMARQUE, Benoît DE COURSON and Léo FITOUCHI.
