We are working to develop a method to improve education and learning in University based on Multi-Level Selection theory, which focuses on how competition between social groups facilitate the emergece of cooperation within these groups. We are mainly inspired by Elinor Ostrom's work on how humans organise to govern common resources in collective autonomy [^1], and its numerous applications in attempting to build inclusive and functional institutions - in particular in the context of the Evolution Institute [^2].

More specifically, we are adapting the Good Behaviour Game [^3] to the context of the University of Aix-Marseille. We suggest the constitution of autonomous but interacting study groups so as to socialise the activity of studying, and relate it to a feeling of collective identity. The implementation of our design is expected to begin in 2021.

The project is currently lead by our team in Marseille, Raphael Renaud, Thomas Suau and Clara Levy Falk and coordinate by Nicolas SALERNO.
