We work to synthesise and diffuse of relevant research regarding cultural evolution and its epistemology (that is, how it builds knowledge and what this knowledge means), which we will publish here, submit to general audiences press, or articulate into public talks.

We have also undertaken to apply cultural evolutionary paradigm to the transmission of knowledge, by adapting Ostrom's Core Design Principles and the following Good Behaviour Game to help sustainable cooperation networks to emerge within student groups.

We also present our work before academic audiences, both as individual members and as a collective. We are currently preparing the student seminar "L'évolution culturelle : vers une science naturelle de l'histoire humaine" for the DEC department of the ENS Ulm. It should have taken place during the second semester of 2019-20, but has been postponed due to the coronavirus crisis.
