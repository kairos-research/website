Humans integrate cultural expectations through their social interactions, but can only do so by recreating the meaning of their experience from their own viewpoint. This gives the opportunity for ambiguity in the relation between the patterns instantiated by social norms and their understanding by individual agents, and therefore for the creative evolution of norms, values and organization. In other words, social organization is maintained into existence because humans learn the landscapes of cultural expectations in which they are immersed, but since this learning is intrinsically subjective and reconstructive, the very same process also drives the continuous evolution of social organization. In the same way that biology centers on the organizational properties of living systems, the vision of historical dynamics we present here centers on the organizational properties of human societies - the cultural landscapes which humans collectively enact, and the social constraints they produce over collective patterns of behavior.</p><p>But it prompts the question: how do cultural landscapes and social constraints affect individual behavior, and how can we describe their change through time? These questions are the central topic of our Cultural Ecology &amp; Cliodynamics research project. At its core, our approach is based in the cognitive science describing human engagement with material and cultural landscapes. We aim to articulate a broader framework accounting for sociocultural <em>autopoiesis</em> (the self-creation of human societies) based on the internalization and externalization of cultural expectations by individual humans. In doing so, we hope to understand the relation between the patterns of meaning projected by human societies and the cultural and material environment they construct. Our goal is ultimately to relate this framework to more classical (quantitative and qualitative) research on <em>longue durée</em> history and on the historical patterns of social dynamics to study the coevolution between cultural traits. In other words, we want to analyse how specific cultural traits or frames of reference constrains social activity, and indirectly the long term evolution of societies.</p><p>Given this core demarch, the topics we take interest in are too various to be exhaustively listed here. What is the role of the material environment in cultural evolution, and in the development of core technology for early human ecology? What is the historical role of urbanization in political and economic organization? Was the role mediated by shared cultural norms embedded in the material niche of the city, by the organic development of social and economic organization, by political authority, or by all of the above? Is the process of urbanization the cradle of contemporary social hierarchies, or is it State stratification? Or patriarchy? If the answer changes across cultural contexts, why does it and how does that inform patterns of social evolution? What drives the relation between economical complexity and democracy across States? Can we model the assumptions of Modern Monetary Theory from the ground up, assuming only what we know about the mechanisms of human cognition? We believe that any student of the historical patterns of change in human societies may find an interest in engaging with us on these topics, and many others.</p><h3 id="related-kairos-articles">Related Kairos articles</h3><ul><li><a href="https://kairos-research.org/clothes-of-the-empire/">The Clothes of the Empire : an Active Inference account of identity capture</a></li><li><a href="https://kairos-research.org/historical-processes/">Cliodynamics, or the study of historical processes</a></li><li><a href="https://kairos-research.org/beyond-state/">Beyond State</a></li></ul><h3 id="our-publications">Our publications</h3><ul><li>Guénin–Carlut, Avel, and Mahault Albarracin. 2023. “On Embedded Normativity - An Active Inference Account of Agency beyond Flesh.” OSF Preprints. <a href="https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/7x8cm">https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/7x8cm</a>.<ul><li>Accepted at the <a href="https://iwaiworkshop.github.io/">4th International Workshop on Active Inference</a></li></ul></li><li>Guenin-Carlut, Avel, Ben White, and Lorena Sganzerla. 2023. “The Cognitive Archaeology of Sociocultural Lifeforms.” In ALIFE 2023: Ghost in the Machine: Proceedings of the 2023 Artificial Life Conference.
