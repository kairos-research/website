Those adaptations develop within socio-economic networks and institutions in which they are effectively embedded, making the possibility of collective adaptation contingent on the scale and structure of underlying coordination.</p><p>Such coordination is difficult to build around political decisions in stratified urban societies, where steep concentration of power around central persons and institutions tends to catalyse polarisation around competing segments of the elite. Failure to integrate complex dynamical dependances between a societyâ€™s structure and its environment in turn result in periodic instability in complex societies, as is currently illustrated by human-driven climate change.</p><p>We work to integrate knowledge about complex dynamics in political discourse and action, and effectively build the capacity for collective agency. We base our approach on two complementary axis : theoretical understand of how complex societies evolve through the long time of history, and practical insight on how to build cooperative networks &amp; institution able to integrate complex information about their environment.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 5, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>This website is registered under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 4.0</a> license.<br>Powered by Publii</p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://kairos-research.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
