            "content_html": "<p>Our views of the relation between science and the natural world tend to gravitate between two defining positions : either science offers us a true (although perhaps limited) representation of physical reality, or our representations of the world (although perhaps useful) simply lack the properties that would make them real. It is sensible to concede to the realist view that the power of scientific knowledge is likely not the outcome of a miracle, but of the intrinsic accuracy of the maps of the world it has developed. But any knowledge must be conceived by a human mind to begin with, and its hard to explain how our evolutionary and social history would have equipped us with just the kind of cognitive machinery that can conceive the ground nature of physical reality. Moreover, has a century of development in quantum physics not done away with the idea of an objective reality ?</p>\n<p>The present article will articulate a third position that integrates the strengths of both the realist and anti-realist position, while giving us some grip on why we are here discussing the issue : participatory realism. Participatory realism is a brainchild of both recent cognitive science and quantum physics, and can be understood as the affirmation that while physical reality exist independently from us, we participate in constructing it through our attempts to understand and manipulate it. Think of the way humans have progressively constructed a niche that fits their bodily needs, while extending their cognitive abilities in the process through emotional care, economic specialization, urbanization, counting, writing, and ultimately the recent turn toward digital technologies. In the same manner, physical observers such as ourselves create a world where their constitutive assumptions remain true, while also expanding the space of accessible states – i.e., constructing physical reality.</p>\n<p>We will first discuss the intricacies of realism, its variants and its negations, and establish how the dichotomy between the positions of “realism” and “anti-realism” is ultimately failed. Then, we will explain the meaning of participatory realism in cognitive science, and more particularly how it emerges from the necessity for cognitive agents to understand their world so as to maintain their structural identity. In particular, we will investigate how this prefigures the role of human sociality and material culture in constructing the ways we have of understanding the world. Finally, we will turn to why any fundamental theory of physics must account for active role of the observer in shaping physical reality, and why our account of the construction of human knowledge offers an appropriate model of this process. Participatory realism will then emerge as an onto-epistemological theory offering an appropriate grounding for both our understanding of the world and our reflexive understanding of our own knowledge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"scientific-realism-and-its-problems\">Scientific realism and its problems</h2>\n<p>Realism, in and of itself, is a very broad statement that we represent things as they actually are. For example, we can call social realism an art movement that aims to show the day-to-day concerns of the working class, and moral realism the idea that moral values constitute an objective truth. The brand of realism we aim to discuss here can be called epistemic realism or scientific realism, and it claims very plainly that our knowledge of the world (as developed through the means of science) translate natural facts preexisting our observations. At first sight, it is hard to see why one would contest this view. If we deny that the external world is simply an hallucination produced by one’s own mind (which we should), then we must surely agree that objects have some kind of underlying reality that is accessible to investigation, and therefore that science can tell us about what they actually are. </p>\n<p>While this argument is reasonable, it would be misleading to present it as a validation of realism. No one contests that there is indeed a physical reality and that science is studying it. What is at stake in the debates surrounding scientific realism is the relation between our models of reality and the natural world. We can agree that there is indeed a physical reality outside of ourselves, but deny that science has the capacity to decide on the “true nature” of the objects which compose it. A strong argument for this position is the underdetermination of theory by evidence (Lakatos 1976): any set of observations can in principle be explained by an array of different theories, and we can have no assurance that all involve the same kind of objects. Our best shot at truth is therefore to do away with theories that directly conflict with evidence, and be very prudent about any claims regarding the reality of the remaining ones.</p>\n<p>The argument from underdetermination, as well as an array of philosophical and sociological concerns about the neutrality of researchers, have driven some researchers to articulate an explicitly anti-realist position about scientific knowledge. For example, Colombo, Hartmann, and van Iersel (2015) hold that explanation in biology simply does not need to commit to the reality of the objects it postulates. To clarify, a model that describes a biological structure (say, the electrochemistry of neuronal activation) as a mechanism works regardless of whether this structure is a mechanism. A mechanical model is explanatory because it tells us how a given biological system can reliably produce a phenomenon of interest, while being thoroughly coherent with everything we know about the system and its activity. But it does not commit us to actually believe that everything in the model is true, from the nature it lends to system component to the description it makes of their relations.</p>\n<p>The idea that models can actually describe real structures while not being “real” in themselves has motivated the development of a bridging position known as structural realism (Ladyman 2020). According to this position, scientific theories and models do not bear onto natural objects in themselves, but onto the relations they have between them. For example, modeling a mechanical body as a point of mass m does not mean that we actually it is point-like, and equipped with an intrinsic mass property of value m. It does mean however that for the purpose of mechanical interaction, it will behave like it was a point equipped with an intrinsic mass m. This position relaxes the requirements for a scientific theory to be valid, as it does need to correspond to an underlying reality but simply to translate known pathways of causality. However, it also dissolves the distinction between realism and anti-realism, as it negates the idea that we can or should know what objects are in themselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"participatory-realism-and-cognitive-agency\">Participatory realism and cognitive agency</h2>\n<p>For the next step of our argument, we will turn away from the question of what we can in principle know about nature, and discuss how we concretely get to know the world. Since we are natural beings, our knowledge of the world reduces to what we can infer from our perception, given the constraints of our cognitive architecture. And this architecture is not a passive receiver of information, like antennas or photographs. Cognitive agents learn about the world by “asking questions”, i.e. by actively looking for information of interest (Fields and Levin 2020). A very simple example is the development of chemical receptors in bacteria and eukaryotes, which enable them perceive and follow sources of nutriments. A more elaborate example is the way we humans flexibly allocate attention to precise their model of the world: what is the next word in this sentence? is this person looking at me? does the sky look like it’s going to rain?</p>\n<p>Let us take the perspective of one of these cognitive agents, more precisely this of a hunter in a forest. The hunter knows a pack of deer is currently roaming this territory, and is looking for signs of their specific position. They notice fresh deer footprints, and immediately start following them. What they actually see is nothing but a simple geometrical pattern imprinted in the ground. It is not detailed instructions on how to go to a given place, or a line on a map. In other words, it only constitutes a path toward a deer for someone who knows what their footsteps look like and is currently looking for one. But the hunter would likely laugh to the suggestion that the deer track is not physical reality, but only a projection of their mind. For them, it is clear as day: they see a deer track just before their eyes, and they know for a fact it will lead them to their prey.</p>\n<p>The deer tracks of the above example do not exist in either the hunter’s mind or the external world, they emerge as a percept at the interface of the two. To the hunter, everything appears as if the deer track was an actual physical object, and they just happened to notice it due to its observable properties (i.e. the presence of footprints). Therefore, they simply perceive the track as real, and use the knowledge of its presence to navigate the world. The same goes for any other physical object. We cannot glimpse at the intrinsic nature of the rain, trees, or dogs, but we can infer what kind of entities underlie our perceptions and then simply treat them as real (Froese 2022). And given the physical nature of cognition, there is no other way we can experience the world. However sophisticated, any cognitive agent experiences a reality of their own making, constructed on the basis of their anticipated percepts (whether explicit or not) (Ramstead et al. 2021; Clark 2019).</p>\n<p>It is critical to understand is that this does not make the world we experience any less real. Whether the deer track preexists to the hunter’s perception does not matter to judging of its reality: for all practical purposes, everything appears as if there indeed was a deer track there, and the hunter just happened to find it. The role of subjective experience in shaping physical reality is most flagrant when agents modify their material environment to fit their expectations, as is prevalent in the human species. However, immaterial norms and knowledge (e.g. on tracking deer) also shape the way we act in the world, and therefore participate to create the kind of trace we imprint onto the world. Therefore, the perceptions we have of the world (up to scientific knowledge) are not either a neutral representation of what’s there, or a simple illusion projected onto physical reality. They fully participate to bring about physical reality by shaping the causal relations between the perceiving agent and the world they navigate. </p>\n<h2 id=\"participatory-realism-and-the-construction-of-physical-reality\">Participatory realism and the construction of physical reality</h2>\n<p>Although it is most intuitive at the scale of biological agents, the notion that perception shapes physical reality goes much deeper. Let us say an agent A acquires information about a system of interest S. By definition, that means that the system’s entropy decreases. As a closed system’s entropy cannot decrease, this entropy has to be offloaded somewhere. As offloading it into either the agent’s or the system’s would instantly void the observation, they must somehow dissipate this entropy as heat in their environment E. But then, unless they can somehow cool down E by the same amount by forgetting about their observation (which no credible physical architecture would allow), it means that they have irreversibly lost information about E. In other words, what observations any given agent can make is constrained by the history of observations it has made in the past, as well as by the computational architecture underlying the observation process.</p>\n<p>Our best efforts seem indicate that this path-dependency is not simply an emergent statistical law, but rather a fundamental property of physical observation. At a quantum level, physical interaction indeed leads to the phenomenon of entanglement where the interacting systems can only take certain value relative to each other. For example, we could constrain two photons to take opposite spin value without deciding what this spin value is. Both photons would remain in a superposition of both possible states, but any observation of one would instantly (i.e., faster than light speed) constrain any future observation of the other’s state. While famously denounced by Einstein as “spooky action at a distance”, this property was nonetheless demonstrated experimentally in the so-called Aspect experiment Aspect, Grangier, and Roger (1982). Even more disturbingly, inserting or removing a detector in similar experimental setting have been shown to retrospectively determine what path a photon has taken before the observation even occurred (Jacques et al. 2007).</p>\n<p>However, these paradoxical violations of the most basic physical constraints imaginable only hold if we abstract the observer from the domain of physical interactions. We can instead attribute the loss of quantum coherence in these experiment to entanglement between the observer and the target system during the process of measurement. Then, there is no need for action at a distance or retrospective causality: as an observer, we are simply constrained to observe states of the world that are consistent with what we observed already (Griffiths 2019; Bacciagaluppi 2020). Entropy then reemerges as the information a given observer can’t access due to his history of past interactions (Tegmark 2012). Quantum states, in themselves, reduce to the knowledge an observer has about the world - although a kind of knowledge that physically constrains the reality we can experience. Because it recognizes an active role of the observer in shaping physical reality, this position was also characterized as “participatory realism” by quantum information theorists  (Fuchs 2017).</p>\n<p>The critical aspect of the present discussion is that the cognitive science and quantum information brands of participatory realism share more than their names. In the same way that cognitive agents need to act on their environment to “ask questions”, quantum observers first need to prepare the system of interest to measure them along specific reference frames (Fields et al. 2021). Most importantly, both processes seem to reduce to the same mathematical view of inference as synchronization-driven construction of the “statespace” which constitutes the natural representation of physical determinants of the process at hand (Guénin–Carlut 2022). In this view, the space of causally effective physical states is constrained by the process of observation itself, based on the imprinting of the agent / observer’s internal dynamics onto the external world. In other words, observation constitutes an actual driver of the construction of physical reality in the strongest possible sense, rather than a passive process of information gathering.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We have hereby introduced the position of “participatory realism” as a synthesis of arguments coming from both cognitive science and quantum information theory. In cognitive science, the argument concerns the way our knowledge of the world is constrained by the processes through which we come to understand it. In quantum information theory, the argument concerns the way physical reality itself is constrained by the physical process of observation. At first sight, these are entirely different statements: one is about what is actually in the world, and the other is one what we can know about it. However, the mathematical unity between those two statements suggest a deeper relation between the processes that construct the world and those by which we understand it. As per the present position, the process by agent actively constrain the world to be able to gather information interest is precisely what drives the unfolding of physical reality.</p>\n<p>This does not mean, of course, that we live in an imagined world where anything we wish can become reality. Humans do not have an exclusive, nor even a privileged, claim to the status of physical observers. It is not likely that whatever processes drive the emergence of spacetime or sexual reproduction will simply go away if we ask them firmly, or that we can even imagine a reality where it would be the case. It is still the case however that our minds and bodies have the capability to project their structure onto observable physical reality, as they do in classical quantum experiment or in our attempts to build a niche that fits our biological needs and extend our cognitive abilities. It is still the case, if this view is in essence correct, that the question of what there is in the world cannot be separated entirely from the question of how we come to know about it.</p>\n<p>This admittedly implicates a huge shift in our understanding of both physical reality and the status of scientific knowledge. However, there is no way in which it contradicts the reality of the world or the validity of scientific knowledge. Participatory realism recognizes there is a world out there, it simply insists that we participate in building it. Because the process of inference it describes is still constrained by the structure and states of the target system, it is still able to account for scientific knowledge as valid representations of causal structure in the natural world. The only reason why it seems so groundbreaking is because it clashes with the intuition that our knowledge is an objective, true representation of the world as it is, detached from the interactions we have with it. But as we have seen here, we have no reason to believe such a representation could even exist, let alone be cognitively accessible to a specie of ultrasocial apes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgement-and-references\">Acknowledgement and references</h2>\n<p>The present work is a companion article to Guénin–Carlut, Avel. 2022. “Physics of Creation - Symmetry Breaking, (En)Active Inference, and Unfolding Statespaces.” OSF Preprints. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/68947\">https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/68947</a>.

            "content_html": "<p>Ideology is an extremely polysemic term, which does not entail more in itself than the existence of some system of belief, values or discourse that is somehow mobilized in the political field. It is sometimes used in debates as a derogatory term, to contrast “ideology” with “rational” discourse based on the common ground of public knowledge, and it is sometimes used (in line with Marxist theory) to analyze the values and beliefs that specific political coalitions project through their public discourse. The goal of the present document is not to provide the world with yet another definition of ideology, but to gesture at sociocultural dynamics underlying the phenomenon we usually associate with ideology, and notably the shaping of public action through carefully crafted narratives.</p>\n<p>The approach I articulate here shares the basic commitment of Olúfémi Táíwò to account for ideology as a practice-oriented phenomenon (O. O. Táíwò 2018), while displaying the role of self- and social identity in shaping public practices. It does so by offering a richer account of how the “common ground” of public knowledge and social constraints emerges from human activities. Most importantly, it formulates the underlying dynamics within a neurocognitively grounded account of the construction of sociocultural landscapes, based on dynamical systems approaches to cognition and more specifically on the formal ontology of Active Inference.</p>\n<p>From this ground, I formalize the concept of “identity capture”, where elites (understood as whoever exert power over others within a given context) manage to shape the common ground for public practices by taking over the population’s sense of identity. I show its roots in the multiple transformations of modern Europe, its relation to the civilizing process and the development of disciplinary institutions, and its mobilization in the construction of the public sphere. Finally, I extend Táíwò’s account of elite capture in identity politics (O. Táíwò 2021; O. O. Táíwò 2022) by showing the vulnerability of “deference politics” to specifically Anglo-American forms of identity capture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-emperors-new-clothes-or-the-common-ground-for-political-action\">The Emperor’s New Clothes, or the common ground for political action</h2>\n<p>Táíwò’s argument on political action and ideology relies heavily on Andersen’s fable named “the Emperor’s New Clothes”, which he recounts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[F]unctionaries of the emperor handed him a hanger, claiming that it held a garment made of a mystical fabric that would appear invisible to anyone incompetent or exceptionally stupid. In fact, the hanger held nothing at all. The emperor put on the “garment” and walked around the town naked. Having heard of the myth claiming that, to point out the obvious, nakedness would confirm one’s own incompetence and unintelligence, none of his subjects dared to point out the obvious—not even the servant assigned to hold the “train” of his nonexistent garment. The spell holds even as the emperor is escorted through the town in a celebratory parade. Finally, a young child yells: “But he hasn’t got anything on.” The spell is broken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The nakedness of the Emperor was there for all to see, and yet it took the ingenuous and irreverential mind of a child for anyone to admit it. Did the townsfolk trust the Emperor’s tale about a magical garment over their own eyes? Most likely, they did believe what they could plainly see, but did not feel empowered to act on that knowledge. To point out the Emperor’s nakedness would be to embarrass oneself, were other townsfolk to see the garment or themselves believe the tale. On the other hand, if they were to agree on the Emperor’s nakedness, it would embarrass the Emperor himself, with the probable consequence of unhinged violence.</p>\n<p>This fable points out a basic but overlooked fact: the private beliefs that one holds do not necessarily match with those that can practically serve as a premise to act or speak within a given context. For example, you can hate your job all you want, and you can vent about it with your friends and co-workers. Were you to tell the same things to the face of your boss or customers, or even display negative feelings in their presence (“Emotional Labor” 2022), it may have serious consequences on your ability to maintain your position.</p>\n<p>In other words, any social interaction is based on a core set of prior beliefs that agents assume are shared, and those priors shape what is socially feasible within a given context. This is known in linguistics as the “common ground” of a conversation, which include all propositions that are accepted as true by its participants (for example, elements of prior common knowledge, or propositions that have been acknowledged within this discussion). In <em>The Empire Has No Clothes</em> (O. O. Táíwò 2018), Táíwò extends this notion to account for all beliefs that one can openly affect in act or speech under the umbrella term of “practical premises”.</p>\n<p>Beside allowing to account for communicative acts beyond speech (e.g., facial expression or targeted violence), the notion of “practical premises” underlies that the beliefs that shape public action need not have anything to do with private beliefs. In the above fable, the role of political power is not to force the belief that the Emperor is not in fact naked, it is to prevent any public acknowledgement of the Emperor’s nakedness. In kind, Táíwò proposes a practice-first account of propaganda, focusing on its role on shaping public behavior.</p>\n<p>The basic set of beliefs that elites project through propaganda indeed shapes what is socially feasible by shaping what is the common ground for social interaction. If a government invests heavily in warning against antinational Western propaganda, any criticism of its action can expectedly be dismissed by associating it to such propaganda. It can also embolden radical nationalists to violently shut down any perceived expression of Western propaganda, such as LGBTQ+ rights activism or accurate journalism about the motivations and conduct of ongoing imperial wars.</p>\n<p>More generally, any basic communicative act participates to set an agenda for further interaction, because it shapes the common ground on which it  is based. For example, a boss could keep bringing attention to minor failings of his employees to signify he could use them to deny a raise, and preemptively close any discussion on the matter. More nefariously, elites could cooperate to hamper the investigation and prosecution of the harassment or killing of its opponents or of specific minorities, therefore signifying they are fair game for further violence.</p>\n<p>The notion of a common ground (or practical premises) for political discourse and action, together with an analysis of what builds this common ground, helps to understand the other basic parable Táíwò builds onto in his discussion of elite capture and deference politics: this of “being in the room” (O. Táíwò 2021). “Being in the room” means that one is granted access to a political space where a given decision or conversation is ongoing, and therefore is <em>de facto</em> capable to weigh in it.</p>\n<p>Táíwò points out that the role of the rooms themselves, as well as the way they are constructed and managed, is typically left out of academic considerations concerning the way political discourse should be shaped. Instead of paying attention to the way the common ground emerges in the rooms of power, political or academic elites tend to rely on “epistemic deference”, which seeks to identify whoever in the room seems most affected by the issue at hand and direct attention toward them.</p>\n<p>In principle, epistemic deference is motivated by standpoint epistemology, i.e., the idea that one’s social status entails some specific forms of knowledge (e.g., about how it’s like to suffer from a given form of marginalization). But in practice, it enables elites to capture identity politics by deferring political responsibility to the marginalized, while presenting it as a symbolic gesture of deference toward them. An especially salient example is that of Barack Obama, as discussed in <em>Elite Capture : How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (and everything else)</em> :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>President Obama explained that he “always believed that change doesn’t come from the top down; it comes from the bottom up. . . It begins with you sharing your stories, fighting for something better.” But what does change coming from the “bottom up” mean, in this context? The president was remarkably explicit: “[I]t goes to show you how one voice can change a room. And if it changes a room, it can change a city. And if it can change a city, it can change a state. And if it can change a state, it can change a nation. If it change[s] the nation, it can change the world.” In other words, the president held forth a model of change flowing through approved channels and hierarchies atop which, ultimately, he stood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Obama, arguably the single most powerful human on Earth at the time, addressing the many structural issues with the institutions he sits atop is the responsibility of the very marginalized population that suffer from them. It is the wretched of the earth’s burden to find time and energy to organize and to tune a message that is powerful enough to change the world, yet palatable enough to be widely coopted and echoed by elites such as himself. Note how Obama avoids committing to any support for such movements were they to succeed, or even to refrain the campaign of counter-propaganda, police violence and targeted assassinations which usually meets Black radicals and environmentalists in the USA.</p>\n<p>Táíwò concedes that epistemic deference is generally the product of good faith tentatives to empower the marginalized, and that it’s preferable to the default attitude of pure callousness. However, it misses the fact that whoever happens to already “be in the room” already benefits from a certain level of privilege, at least in the form of the education enabling them to express their thoughts in a contextually appropriate way. They cannot represent the standpoint of the wider communities they’re expected to stand for.</p>\n<p>In contrast to epistemic deference, Táíwò discusses the way Black radicals have systematically attempted to build rooms of power and knowledge where marginalized communities could express their views freely and reach a common ground for collective action. He discusses in specific depth the history of the PAIGC, a decolonial organization that has united Bissau-Guineans and Cape Verdans in their struggle against the Portuguese Empire.</p>\n<p>In particular, the PAIGC insisted on the active participation of women in political affairs, and on a massive campaign for the education of children. In a conservative social context, where the overwhelmingly agricultural economy critically relies on child labor, those were costly positions. However, they enabled a wider permeation of decolonial ideas, and deconstruction of colonial agenda-setting (e.g., regarding African susceptibility to Eurasian illnesses).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the decolonial movement succeeded in coordinating opposition in Portugal, Cape Verde and Bissau-Guinea and topple both fascist domination over Portugal, and Portuguese domination over its colonies. Táíwò largely attributes this success to the ability of the PAIGC to “build a new house”, which empowered cooperation both within and between national communities, despite important tensions following from the historical role of Portuguese and Cape Verdean elites in managing the trade of Bissau-Guineans as slaves.</p>\n<p>This discussion will serve as a basic starting point for a formalization of elite capture and ideology in terms of the neurocognitive formalism called “Active Inference”. As we will see, it grounds Táíwò’s accent on a practice-first approach to propaganda and political power by formalizing the common ground as a socio-cultural landscape produced by expectations over each other’s representations. However, it also enables us to perceive and discuss the specific mechanisms of “identity capture”, where elites manage to control “private” beliefs by structuring what we expect about ourselves.</p>\n<h2 id=\"self-identity-in-the-construction-of-sociocultural-landscapes\">Self-identity in the construction of sociocultural landscapes</h2>\n<p>The status of Active Inference as a scientific object is muddled by its dual grounding in mathematics and cognitive neuroscience, its intricate formalism, its rich conceptual implications, and the dense stream of criticism and revision that are still shaping its structure at the moment &gt; [while I’m writing or as I write these words, as it is sounds strange]I write. We are interested here in the “low road” to Active Inference (Parr, Pezzulo, and Friston 2022), that is in the model it proposes for human cognition. Just be aware that there is another “high” road to Active Inference, which grounds the very same ideas in the mathematics of self-organizing systems.</p>\n<p>The core idea in Active Inference is that cognitive systems, such as the human brain, function by systematically predicting the sensorimotor states they experience. In other words, the reality you live in is not made of objects you represent mentally to the best of your abilities and in which you decide of your future actions. Instead, your experience is shaped by your anticipation (as entailed by your brain dynamics) of what you’re going to see, hear, or do (Clark 2019; Ramstead et al. 2021), in which the external world only intervenes as you pay attention to what is relevant to refine your predictions.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, such a bold theory has a myriad of interesting consequences. It meshes deeply cognition with the bodily states and social environment of the agent (Clark 2013; Nave et al. 2020). Expectations over one’s internal sensations blend with expectations over one’s actions and their outcome, allowing one to develop affects - sensations about “how they feel” about something. And this web of sensations and anticipations blend, in turn, with expectations over how others will feel about what we think and do, embedding our cognition in a rich network of social norms and symbols.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, at least as far as our discussion goes, it dissolves our legacy notion of agency. Agents do not perceive the world, then think about how to get what they want, decide on a course of action and act; they continuously predict their sensorial flow, and their prediction about their proprioceptive sensations (e.g., the states of their muscles) brings about by itself the expected actions (Hipólito et al. 2021). The notion of a desire detached from action or perception disappears, as the will of agents reduces to what sensations they expect to be most consistent with their continued existence (Clark 2020).</p>\n<p>Let us turn back to the fable of the naked emperor. Do the townsfolk actually believe that the emperor is naked, or do they (as Táíwò insists) simply feel powerless to point out the obvious? The answer one can provide based on Active Inference is straightforward, although counter-intuitive: there simply is no difference between those two propositions. By anticipating a stream of actions and sensations where the Emperor is in fact clothed, the townsfolk functionally believe that the Emperor is clothed. There is no “private domain” where they can hold contrary beliefs - at least not one that’s relevant to explaining what’s going on at the parade.</p>\n<p>To clarify what this means, we’ll have to turn to the specifics of the Active Inference account of the construction and integration of culture. In line with Táíwò’s own account, it is interested in the common ground of social interactions, in the actions it affords and in the dynamics that build it. In contrast, however, they conceptualize the common ground as a system of shared regimes of expectations over what actions are expected in a given context. Very literally, humans integrate and enact cultural norms by “Thinking through other minds” (Veissière et al. 2020), and the way we’ll formalize this process imports all of its specificities.</p>\n<p>Notably, because of the blending of belief and agency under Active Inference, the sociocultural landscape is not only that agents can perceive objectively and rationally assess while taking decisions over what actions they will take. It compels to act, by providing specific expectations over what one will do in a given situation, which (in virtue of the predictive nature of action under Active Inference) brings about the very behavior one expects to enact. And faced with a powerful man, clearly believing he is clothed and surrounded by men in arms who are paid to protect his honor with violence, one clearly expects that they will keep their mouth shut about the amount of naked skin they can see if they are to go on with their life.</p>\n<p>The same is true for any human institution, especially those associated with political power (say, the law or currency). Their existence is conditioned, at any point in time, on our shared belief about their existence. The slave could just get up and leave, if both themselves and their masters just happen to forget about the institutions of slavery. But the slave knows the master won’t forget, and the master knows the slave won’t forget. So everyone expects everyone (including themselves) to keep following the underlying institution, and just in virtue of this the institution keeps on existing.</p>\n<p>In other words, the sociocultural landscape that townsfolk experience around the Emperor and his men directly entails the functional belief that he is, in fact, clothed. As Táíwò underlines, whether this follows from a consistent private belief or from the power asymmetry between the Emperor and the townsfolk is essentially irrelevant for the fable, and for the practice-first picture of political power it paints. At the end, the Emperor is not humiliated because he failed to convince everyone he was indeed clothed, but because he could not compel the townsfolk to act as if he was in his own presence.</p>\n<p>However, this analysis misses a key point in the dynamics underlying political power, namely the role of one’s sense of identity. As noted just above, one’s expectation that they will accept that the Emperor is clothed brings about by itself the functional belief that the Emperor is clothed. But this expectation is specific to one’s actions in a given context, namely in the presence of the Emperor and his men. Once they passed the turn of the street, there is no reason to pretend that one has not seen the Emperor’s naked skin - unless one truly believes in the tale of the invisible fabric, or expects others to do so.</p>\n<p>We already saw that, under Active Inference, deference to the Emperor was brought about by the expectation that one would display such behavior in the context of the procession. What we did not emphasize is that this expectation concerns rather basic sensorimotor couplings: curbing you neck when you see the Emperor, praising His rule ardently so that He notices you, doing nothing to embarrass Him - especially while you see men in arms lurking. It certainly has nothing to do with an abstracted sense of oneself as a person.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the notion of a “self” as a true and acontextual expression (or source) of one’s nature is specific to a handful of cultures, and does not trivially map onto actual cognitive processes. The human sense of self-identity is indeed eminently contextual, as it relies on one’s projection (and history) in a myriad of instrumental and social interactions (Bolis and Schilbach 2018). There is no reason that the devotion produced by the Emperor’s presence translates into anything in his absence, let alone in a sense of oneself as someone devoted to his authority.</p>\n<p>Certainly, it does not mean much for the Emperor. His power derives from the symbolic authority his offices holds, on the efficiency and fidelity of the bureaucracy he commands, and on his ability to leverage taxation and violence through his armed forces. What his population privately think or say about him changes very little for his purposes if it does not translates into public disorder. But a more ambitious Empire could however be tempted to discipline its population into internalizing the norms it projects, either as a way to prevent instability or to command more power over their concrete actions. </p>\n<p>Indeed, were devotion to the Empire somehow integrated into one’s core sense of self-identity, one would do in any situation what they perceive to express devotion to the Empire. In other words, a population that was persuaded that it wanted to serve the Empire by its own volition can be expected to do so without active monitoring. This could mean symbolic gestures such as praising its rule or waving a flag, this could mean spontaneously following the rules, and this could mean marching onto the enemy in synchrony with one’s regiment under fire. </p>\n<p>The social power of capturing one’s sense of identity is documented under the name of “identity fusion”, a phenomenon where individual self-identity literally merges with group identity (Swann Jr. et al. 2012) (typically as a result of shared dysphoric experiences). Given the present account, it is unsurprising that identity fusion can drive extreme forms of cooperation (up to self-sacrifice). Indeed, group norms would immediately affect one’s self-model and can therefore directly entail whatever action is socially expected.</p>\n<p>In other words, an Empire that would rule by building a sense of collective identity and somehow working it into his population’s self-model would command much greater power than our naked Emperor, who relies on direct coercion and symbolic authority. It would be able to just show the direction and expect people to follow it unconditionally, whatever the consequences. It would be able to persuade the people that the Emperor was indeed clothed, as they are not the kind of person who would see Him naked or doubt the tale of the magical garment. This is the core of identity capture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"identity-capture-from-modern-nationalism-to-deference-politics\">Identity capture from modern nationalism to deference politics</h2>\n<p>The extreme violence of modern European geopolitics and the democratization of the printing press offered an ideal context to catalyze the development of identity capture. Elites publicly debated about political goals and strategies, offering the people some grip over what was going on in the rooms of power. Most importantly, they started to use the language of kinship and shared identity to exhort members of their linguistic and political communities to action. </p>\n<p>States started to insist that they somehow represented the collective will of a community of kin known as the Nation. National identity became embedded in all aspects of social life, leveraging the language of friendship and family to redirect one’s sense of belonging from one’s social network to the political organization itself (Malešević 2013). Nationalism emerged, and with it the modern model of Nation-States.</p>\n<p>At the same time, they developed an array of technologies and institutions aimed to make their population and territory legible to their administrative tools and their propaganda. For example, States started to insist that both places and people should have a single given name that would make them legible to the administrative lenses, through which they see the world (Scott 2010). They also promoted the hegemony of national language and identity, both by large scale education programs and by the active suppression of regional identity.</p>\n<p>Most strikingly, modern Europe has produced an array of “disciplinary institutions” which served to integrate social norms in the self-identity of people so intimately that escaping them would become impossible. Discipline functioned through both rituals of embodied synchronization which embedded those norms in basic sensorimotor schemes (as expressed for example in rhythmic military march), and constant (panoptical) monitoring ultimately aimed to train individuals to self-monitor their own normative expression (Foucault 2011).</p>\n<p>Modern Nation-States, due to the impersonal nature and ostensible egalitarianism of their institutions, could not call onto the exceptional stature of its leaders to justify their authority. Because of this, they were a natural fit for the bourgeois class, whose wealth did not derive from personal rights over others but from their ability to build networks of relations and organize trade. In countries such as France, which were not subject to foreign influence, bourgeoisie was the main support for and beneficiary of nationalist ideology.</p>\n<p>For example, a largely bourgeois-dominated National Assembly decided to execute French King Louis XVIth in 1793 for having conspired with foreign powers against national interests, triggering the French Revolution. Although the Parisian merchants who powered the Revolution were rapidly sidelined by a largely moderate Parliament, the core institutions of liberal capitalism and nationalism were not ever seriously threatened in French history - even under the restoration of the monarchy.</p>\n<p>Frail and unstable as it was, the revolutionary Parliament proceeded to leverage national identity and the powerful French administration to resist the successive monarchist coalitions that would crush it in retaliation (and most importantly to dissuade nationalists at home to try the same). This came to an apex when France briefly came to dominate European politics through pure military might, after a neo-monarchist coalition took over State apparatus and reorganized it around the personal cult of military leader Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>\n<p>Under the modern order, any government could be replaced, but the absurd power of disciplinary control and identity capture could not. States were forced to either integrate it in their core structure, or collapse under the pressure of States which did. The Nation-States of France, Britain, and Prussia became increasingly dominant, while kingdoms were integrated into larger national polities and Empires crumbled as their multiples constituent ethnical groups claimed their right to self-determination.</p>\n<p>The elite who wielded this power were the same who dominated the economic and legal spheres. They reorganized economic production around factories, yet another kind of disciplinary institution that made workers effectively replaceable at the same time they imprinted in their very bodies the habit of submission to authority. It is no wonder that neither nationalism nor capitalism could easily be opposed. And it is no wonder that, when it finally was, it was by the very means of disciplinary control and identity capture.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the first communist faction to take over a State relied centrally on disciplinary control and identity capture. The Bolsheviks were indeed keen to leverage the discipline of the factory to control the workers’ lives and shut down their spontaneous agency, as expressed in the debates between their leader Lenin and democratic socialist Luxembourg. They even wiped out the preexisting agricultural economy to enforce the supposedly alienating model of the factory in order to take over the rural population’s life (Scott 2020)</p>\n<p>Bolsheviks indeed had a very defined idea of what was a worker, and it was someone who was entirely devoted to the Party. The police State that they proceeded to build monitored the population for any expression of “counterrevolutionary” behavior, which it repressed in blood. Importantly, this affected objective enemies of socialism as well as its working class base and rival socialist organizations (2019). The social identity of workers and socialist was reified and used as an instrument for social control to the benefit of a tiny elite.</p>\n<p>Around the same period, the British empire started leveraging an interesting variant of identity capture to control oil-rich zones of the ex-Ottoman Empire. They projected the European norms of ethnicity onto local population, appointed local elites to represent for wider ethnical groups, and declared themselves the guardians of minority rights and <em>de facto</em> arbiters of any conflicts between the ethnic group they defined (Mitchell 2013). Given that people were governed by elites sharing their ethnicity (according to British classification), this arrangement respected the right to self-determination as defined by Europeans at the height of nationalism.</p>\n<p>But by voluntarily inviting local elites to negotiate in their own room, the British effectively defined what was the common ground of the negotiation. Sure, elites could decide not to agree to the British terms, but they’d loose the backing of the British against the interests of rival groups or rival elites within the group. The British could organize the systematic destruction of local nationalism and syndicalism to prevent any disruption in the flow of oil, while insisting it actually represented the local population’s will (as expressed in treaties with their representatives).</p>\n<p>The same basic approach would show useful in the United States of America when the pressure of Black activism forced the end of the apartheid and threatened to redefine the rules of racial capitalism entirely. Black activism was systematically repressed, especially the most radical forms such as Marxist-Leninist Black Panther Party - up to the assassination of leader Fred Hampton by a FBI-led death squad (Williams 2013). At the same time, more moderate leaders were systematically patronized and incited toward more moderation. In the terms of Martin Luther King Jr (Gelderloos 2007) : </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Apart from bigots and backlashers, it seems to be a malady even among those whites who like to regard themselves as “enlightened.” I would especially refer to those who counsel, “Wait!” and to those who say that they sympathize with our goals but cannot condone our methods of direct-action in pursuit of those goals. I wonder at men who dare to feel that they have some paternalistic right to set the timetable for another man’s liberation. Over the past several years, I must say, I have been gravely disappointed with such white “moderates.” I am often inclined to think that they are more of a stumbling block to the Negro’s progress than the White Citizen’s Counciler [sic] or the Ku Klux Klanner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Surrealist TV series Atlanta, in its acerb criticism of racial relations in the USA, points out in season 1, episode 9 the idealized identity that white elites project onto Black Americans. At some point, an upper class white liberal characterized by his own wife as having “Black people as a hobby” brags about his pilgrimage to Africa, and insist the Black protagonist should do the same as it’s his “Motherland”. He then asks him what precise subpart of Africa his ancestors are from, only for him points out that he doesn’t know since “this spooky thing called slavery happened, and my entire ethnic identity was erased”. </p>\n<p>In this scene, ostensible deference to a largely projected African identity serves only to assert dominance over the protagonist. The white liberal that Black identity calls specific actions on one’s part, and that his culture grants him authority to define what those actions are. The protagonist is visibly creeped out by this bizarre attitude, but has to play along not to threaten his partner’s career opportunities. This illustrate the ability of the elite to appropriate the voices of the marginalized by forcing them to play by the rules of a room they set to their own advantage.</p>\n<p>The elite can also generate extremely distorted version of marginalized perspectives under the guise of deference, or even make things up entirely. A recent example would be the appropriation of intersectional arguments by centrists to disqualify Bernie Sanders, an historical supporter of civil rights movements, leading to a disambiguation of the meaning of intersectional politics by one of its founders (Smith 2020). This is a specific instance of a centrist agenda-setting campaign seeking to establish the opposition of identity politics with left-wing politics, and therefore incapacitate any questioning of racial capitalism.</p>\n<p>In other words, deference politics offers numerous opportunities for the elite to suppress or appropriate marginalized perspectives that they ostensibly champion. They can define rules for dyadic interaction that facilitate identity capture, and leverage both their dominance in interpersonal relations and careful agenda setting to enforce these rules at scale. Standpoint epistemology is only meaningful if the marginalized are empowered to organize and assert their perspectives as they see fit, rather than serve as an <em>a posteriori</em> justification that elite decision has integrated all of the relevant information.</p>\n<p>This only strengthen Táíwò’s call for “constructive politics”: if the old rooms are built to reassert elite dominance, building new rooms is necessary for effectively articulating marginalized perspectives into a concrete political program. The question driving the attribution of our political attention shifts from “who is habilitated to speak about a certain issue?” to “what institutions are necessary to organize a coordinated answer to a certain issue?”.</p>\n<p>If we want to prevent the capture of our lives and political revendications by elite interests, we need at the very least to impose that the decisions concerning us are taken in rooms we are in, and whose common ground enable us to speak in our terms. The very existence of a “control room” where a few people aggregating all of the relevant information to take decisions for the many entails that one’s right to decide for oneself has been alienated. Whether the people in this room are in some sense like us or claim to represent our perspective changes nothing to that fact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The present article revisits in terms of Active Inference Táíwò’s account of propaganda through his core parable of the naked Emperor. It supports the central point of his argument, namely that the purpose of propaganda (and political power more generally) is to shape public behavior rather than private beliefs. More specifically, it claims that this process is mediated by the construction of a socio-cultural landscape (equivalent to Táíwò’s common ground or public practical premises) which directly compels action by defining one’s expectations about their own behavior in a given context.</p>\n<p>This account suggests that another, deeper kind of power can emerge when social norms are not integrated in concrete experience but in an abstracted and acontextual sense of self-identity. This process, which I coin as “identity capture”, enables an indirect although powerful and intimate form of government where elites define and enforce specific social identities embedding strong normative expectations. The modern European era has seen the development of an array of mechanisms falling under this umbrella, especially under the guise of nationalism. </p>\n<p>Deference politics enables a specific form of identity capture, where elites affect support for civil rights movements while forcing them to operate in elite rooms where they cannot accurately stand for the interests of their basis. To build an horizontal, collective understanding of our world despite the pressure of elite capture, we need to build rooms where the common ground enables the expression of anyone and facilitates collective organization. We can find models in organizations and movements that resisted the power relations inherent to the modern order : Black radicals and modern decolonials (as Táíwò underlies), but also anarchists, pre-modern European communalism, and indigenous resistance to colonization (Shoatz 2017).</p>\n<h2 id=\"bibliography\">Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bolis, Dimitris, and Leonhard Schilbach. 2018. “Observing and Participating in Social Interactions: Action Perception and Action Control across the Autistic Spectrum.” Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, Autism Spectrum Condition – understanding sensory and social features, 29 (January): 168–75. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2017.01.009\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2017.01.009</a>.</li>\n<li>Clark, Andy. 2013. “Whatever next?

No mechanism exist to meaningfully relate research to important social issues, as academic fame is indexed on article productivity and mass media tends to echo a sensationalised version of scientific results. Consequently, common citizen have no visibility on the functioning on science, and feel no responsability to take scientific knowledge into account.</p>\n<p>We recognise that science can only work as a guide for social life if people can developp the necessary tools to decrypt the meaning of scientific results. Although vulgarisation does help with the diffusion of scientific results, active participation is necessary to build engagement and enable deeper knowledge integration. The transmission of science therefore necessitates not only explaining in accessible terms, but also building spaces where open dialogue on philosophical and scientific issues is possible and encouraged.</p>\n<p>In order to build such a space, Kairos animates a Twitch channel aiming to engage a non-expert audience with research on dynamical systems and socio-cultural evolution. We present books and articles we work on as a material for discussion, while picking each week’s topic based on audience interests. We hope to provide people an opportunity to learn more about what scientific results they think are relevant to guide themselves, and discuss what is their concrete ethical meaning.</p>\n",

Social structure and communication media crucially constrains its effective occurence, and therefore our ability to create a cultural niche embodying information about our world.</p>\n<p>Today, the increasingly manifest feedback of human activities on their ecology suggests the imminence of an era of drastic environmental complexity. As pressure from social polarisation and climate change build up, the socio-political and ecological reality derives away from the relatively stable niche that has forged modern institutions. The possibility of systemic failure becomes more manifest every day, compelling us to rebuild our ability for collective action.</p>\n<p>Ergodic Design studies how living systems create stable niches from complex environments, and seeks to derives practical ways for humans to navigate chaos. We build tools to help visualise, understand and communicate on complex systemic dependancies, allowing collectives to find appropriate ways to engage with the world. Our work integrates approaches from the Active Inference Framework to applied collective intelligence, bridging fundamental research to direct action.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>Academic publications are the basic tool for the development of scientific knowledge, due to their accent on technical precision and explicit situation within well-defined fields of study. However, this technicality itself empedes the transdisciplinary integration of our understanding of complex issues and the development of reflective insight concerning the meaning of any tool or result. This drives the deconnection of research from socially relevant questions, and bring us to passively follow socio-historical trajectories with no tool to evaluate the long term consequences of our decisions.</p>\n<p>Kairos participates in the construction of pragmatic insight about socio-historical dynamics by hosting a journal of scientific synthesis. Its mandate, complementary to this of academic journals, is to integrate knowledge about complex systems, socio-historical dynamics, and epistemology into understanding of the evolution of human societies. Although its thematics are wide by construction, the Kairos journal aims to build focus and reflectiveness through minimalism by design: it does not provide any information that is not necessary to leverage scientific research into a pragmatic understanding.</p>\n<p>The Kairos journal is run in a purely voluntary manner, and does not practice formal peer review. Rather than constituting an authoritative source, it seeks to create a dynamic of reflexive understanding beyond its formal output. Authors are encouraged to work with editors so as to identify what are the pragmatically relevant axis of their research, and readers are encouraged to leverage their insight into action or into more research. We aim to hereby catalyse the cultural evolution of new, hopefully better, ways to do research and integrate it into social life.</p>\n",

Those structures are not pre-given, but are continuously recreated along with the environment and the social relations in which they are embedded. Understanding how human societies work therefore entails the study of how human culture change through time.</p>\n<p>One central aspect of this dynamic is that each cultural trait changes the landscape in which itself and other traits evolve. For exemple, the emergence of agriculture enabled the emergence of densely populated settlements and centralised political control, which consequently further the progress of agricultural subsistence. Just like living organism, cultural forms create the niche they evolve to fit in.</p>\n<p>We propose to study the stucture of human societies through the multi-scale patterns of coevolution shaping cultural forms. Cultural traits should in our view be understood through their participation in a cultural ecosystem of interrelated beliefs and practices.

Failure to integrate complex dynamical dependances between a society’s structure and its environment in turn result in periodic instability in complex societies, as is currently illustrated by human-driven climate change.</p>\n<p>We work to integrate knowledge about complex dynamics in political discourse and action, and effectively build the capacity for collective agency.

Although there is no definitive agreement on the concrete requirements of such a demarch, it can still work as a driving principle for researchers. For exemple, it is especially compelling that the philosophy of knowledge should be grounded on the social and cognitive sciences, and serve to guide the development of further knowledge.</p>\n<p>We propose to take the perspective of an agent struggling to enact meaning into a complex and impermanent reality as a central unifying framework in science and its philosophy. All living systems, including scientists and philosophers, must understand their world and act appropriately to maintain their structural identity. We recognise this process of “enaction” or “active inference” as central in driving biological, cognitive, and social dynamics from the level of cells to this of human societies, and work to expose its role at all possible scales.</p>\n",
